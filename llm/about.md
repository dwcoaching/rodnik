Rodnik.today
The geo-monitoring web application for sharing user reports on the state of public water sources worldwide.
Date of birth: August 28, 2021.

Concept
Rodnik.today is based on the following principles:

Easy access to open geo-information
Focused on Community and voluntary sourcing of data 
Concern for the public good
Globality, independence and non-commercial approach

Functionality
The System contains information about almost a million water sources around the world. Objects are marked on the map. Any Internet user can submit a report on the current state of an arbitrary object, attach several photos and subjectively assess water quality. All reports uploaded by the user are visible to all, so anybody can get the latest field information on the object of their interest.

Architecture
Rodnik.today implements a user interface to geo-data from its internal and third-party open resources. Currently, the global OpenStreetMap project is used as the geo-database. In future, it is planned to integrate with other global and local open sources of geodata.
The Voluntary GIS (VGIS) approach is used to collect live day-by-day data from the community. The system maintains its own VGIS data layer on top of the static map data to keep track of the current state and the retrospective of water objects. 

Progress
More than a year have passed since the release date of the trial (v.0.1) version of the system. Now there are over 30 registered users in our Community. These users have already entered almost 3000 water source reports in Spain, Russia, Andorra, Italy, Israel, Greece, Turkey, Finland, South Korea, Japan, Northern Ireland, Latvia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, France, Slovenia, Hungary, Azerbaijan, Serbia, Montenegro, etc…
With 0.1 version the proof of concept of the System has been completed. Version 1.0 is currently under development.


Cooperation
We invite travellers, sportsmen, tourist guides, wild nature preservation activists and local history enthusiasts to use detailed information about public sources of drinking water that Rodnik.today provides. We would appreciate your reviews and ideas on improving the System. 

We also encourage everybody to contribute their local knowledge to improve and validate open geospatial information through VGIS (Volunteer Geoinformation System) functionality of Rodnik.today. Working together we can accumulate valuable data about the current state of water resources worldwide.

We would also be interested in cooperation with communities running their particular projects related to the maintenance of public water sources. We would be happy to understand your specific needs and will try to adapt Rodnik.today functionality to facilitate the data collection process.

Rodnik.today Team is also open to deeper cooperation. If you are personally interested in the topic of volunteer geo-monitoring and public water sources - join us! Our team rests on the enthusiasm, curiosity and creativity of its members. We are just doing what we love and you are welcome! 


The Team
The Project was started by a small group of programmers and outdoor enthusiasts from Russia. Very soon a community of people interested in the problem of public water sources rallied around the idea. The project, having thus received several development centres, has become international. Nowadays more than 10 people are directly and constantly involved in the development and implementation of the System. We are located in the following countries: Finland, Spain, Russia, Armenia, and Turkey. The software development is based particularly in Helsinki.

The Core Team is surrounded by the wider community of contributors who run local monitoring projects focused on various types of water sources in specific locations. The border between these two circles is very blurry. Our concept is to support collaboration between enthusiasts, to adapt the System to the specificity of particular monitoring campaigns and 
to attract more participants to the core Project team from there.

The Core Team accumulates significant expertise in such areas as:
Open GIS
Building specialised social networks for volunteered monitoring
Hydrology
Sustainable development of recreational resources


Why are we doing this?

WATER IS LIFE
Public water sources hold tremendous significance in our lives, impacting our lifestyle, health, culture, recreation, history, and entertainment. Despite their uniqueness across different geographies, they possess universal importance. By accumulating global knowledge about these vital resources and providing easy access to this information, we contribute to a significant public good.
VOLUNTEERING GEO-DATA
Everyday observations shared among individuals can create invaluable and exclusive geo-information resources. Success lies in developing the right technology platform to foster their passion for sharing.
THE PERFECT TIMING
From the technological and socio-psychological points of view, now is the very right moment to launch a volunteer geospatial monitoring platform for natural resources.

Rodnik.today in the nowadays GIS landscape
We are striving to enhance traditional GIS with the following features:
Interactive
Editable
Multiuser

The name "Rodnik.today"
Since the project initially started in Russia, its name has Russian roots. "Rodník" signifies the place where natural groundwater emerges on the surface. The suffix "today" is also not coincidental, we use it in all our projects related to public monitoring. Rodnik.today is not our team's first project in this domain. Our previous project, Sneg.today, has been successfully operating and evolving since 2017. Sneg.today comprises a set of interconnected online resources (social networks, communicators, and a website) for volunteer monitoring of ski trail conditions.
